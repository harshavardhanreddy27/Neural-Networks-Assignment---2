Neural Networks &amp; Deep Learning Assignment - 2

### Question 1A: The code takes user input for their first and last names, concatenates them using a function called `fullname`, and then prints the resulting full name.

### Question 1B: The code defines a function `string_alternative` that creates a new string with every second character of the input string. It then applies this function to the string "Good Evening" and prints both the original and modified strings. The output will display every second character of the input string.

### Question 2: The code reads the contents of a file named 'input.txt', counts the occurrences of each word, and prints the total number of words and the count of each unique word to the console. It then writes the same information to an output file named 'output.txt'. The program handles words in a case-insensitive manner and considers words separated by spaces.

### Question 3: The code converts heights from inches to centimeters using both a nested loop and list comprehension. It prompts the user to enter heights in inches separated by commas, converts them to centimeters, and then prints the original heights, heights in centimeters using a nested loop, and heights in centimeters using list comprehension. The program handles invalid input by catching a `ValueError` and notifying the user to enter valid numbers. The main functionality is encapsulated in the `convert_to_cm_nested` and `convert_to_cm_list_comprehension` functions.
